# Sparkbox Team Availability Planner

For about 10 weeks I was a developer on a small team that built an internal company tool. The goal of this tool was to help the company's project managers make decisions when scheduling team members for future work. 

## My Role 

In this project I was on a small team of developers who turned designs and application logic into code. The majority of the work I did for this project happened on the front end. Since this project used NextJS, a lot of my work consisted of building and styling React components. I also was responsible for making sure that the project met web accessibility standards. Additionally, I met often with the project's designer to refine the designs as the project progressed. 

## Technical Overview


This first technical choice for this app was to use NextJS as a framework. NextJS made the most sense for this project for a several reasons. One main reason is that many developers at this company have a high level of familiarity with NextJS. This means the number of developers who could perform maintenance on this project is high.

The next technical choice was to use SCSS for styling. It was also decided to use [ITCSS](https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/) alongside [BEM class naming conventions](https://sparkbox.com/foundry/bem_by_example) to organize our styles.
