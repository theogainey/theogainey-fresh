# Sparkbox Team Availability Planner

For about 10 weeks I was a developer on a small team that built an internal company tool. The goal of this tool was to help the company's project managers make decisions when scheduling team members for future work. 

## My role 

In this project I was on a small team of developers who turned designs and application logic into code. The majority of the work I did for this project happened on the front end. Since this project used NextJS, a lot of my work consisted of building and styling React components. I also was responsible for making sure that the project met web accessibility standards. Additionally, I often met with the project's designer to refine the designs as the project progressed. 

## Tech Stack
